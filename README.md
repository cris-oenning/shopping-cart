4 - After your purchase, your balance will decrease and if you want to make a new purchase, click on the arrow to return to the market on the arrow in the upper left corner and make a new purchase with your new balance.

# Functionalities:

* User can add their name and enter cash balance available for purchases.

* A list of products is available for selection, allowing the user to choose which products to buy and in what quantity.

* When adding products to the shopping cart, you can view the purchase total and the remaining balance available.

* The user can choose between different payment methods, each with its specific interest rate. This interest will affect the final purchase price, including the final available balance.

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of the ContextAPI in React, providing an interactive grocery shopping cart experience. It's a practical example of how to manage shared state in a React app using the ContextAPI.

Feel free to explore and customize this project to suit your specific needs. We hope this shopping cart application is helpful in understanding and applying ContextAPI concepts in React.

Have fun shopping!
